Insertion sort is a  sorting algorithm that works similar to the way we sort playing cards in our hands.
The array is split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

To sort an array in ascending order:
1- We iterate over the array and compare the current element (key) to its predecessor
2- If the key element is smaller than its predecessor, we compare it to the elements before.
3- We move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.
